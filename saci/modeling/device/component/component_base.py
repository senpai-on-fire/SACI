    """A ComponentBase is the base class for all components in the system. A component, at a high-level, is any device
    in the full system that can interface with at least one other device, whether at a dataflow level or a physical
    level.

    Components have `parameters`, which are time-invariant properties of the component that affect its behavior for
    analysis, modeling, and simulation purposes. Examples include the weight of a chassis and a firmware file for a
    microcontroller. The parameters expected and their types should be given as the `parameter_types` property. Not
    all the parameters have to be supplied, in order to allow refining the modeling over time or test different
    assumptions for parameter values.

    TODO regarding parameters:
     - a way for components to tell which parameters are needed for a given type of simulation/analysis or
       abstraction level
     - default parameter values, or a default distribution of parameter values to sample from to check robustness
       when modeling with incomplete information
     - replace the current dict-based parameter_types/parameters with something class-based

    Components also have `ports`, which are points of connection to other components. These can be used to signify
    physical, electrical, or other types of connections with data flow.

    TODO regarding ports:
     - ways to indicate whether a connection between two ports is valid at a given abstraction level and, if not, how
       to make it valid
     - different representations of the same ports (as in the Blueprint format), to eventually use for different
       abstraction levels/simulation types
